# knowledge-distillation-based-audio-tagging

The uploaded [draft](KD_Audio_Tagging.pdf) details our research effort towards Urban Sound Tagging, which is an Audio Event Detection problem. We propose a novel approach to apply Knowledge Distillation on a complex feature-fusion classifier to improve performance of individual branches of the classifier, each trained using a different time-frequency representation.
